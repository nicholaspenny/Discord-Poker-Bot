Discord Poker Bot

This is an original Discord bot that serves as a multipurpose tool to assist with the running of poker sessions on pokernow.com.

It serves as a message interpreter, graph generator, and accesses a database containing player information, and history of previous sessions.

Setup
This implementation is always running as it is not using commands but instead responding to each message.
DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN is an environment variable that should be assigned to the token for your specific Discord bot.
